# Copy this file to `.env` or `.env.local` and fill in real values.
# Environment variables are not required for the stub implementation,
# but this template centralizes secrets and runtime toggles.

# Non-secret runtime toggles moved to ~/.easy.env so Finder launches can read them.
# Keep secrets and deployment-only values here.
